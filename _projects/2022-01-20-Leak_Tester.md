# The Challenge
Developed a testing fixture to leak test all IFD sensors from production in pressure and vacuum. Objective of project was to improve test-time and accuracy. This design had to be implemented on a tight schedule due to supply chain and quality issues.

# What I learned
Gained experience creating detailed CAD models and mechanical drawings in SolidWorks for machining. Resulted in improving efficiency from previous tester by 400% with a 4-chamber concurrent testing design and removed potential for false results by eliminating technique dependencies. 
Considered material selection consideration with aluminum, steel, plastic and rubber/sealing parts. Sourcing components like pneumatic components, bolts, dowel pins, studs.
