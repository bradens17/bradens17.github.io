# The Challenge
Within a collaborative team comprising both Engineering and Commerce students, we are embarking on a venture aimed at innovating a distinctive ankle brace. Recognizing a prevalent issue where individuals are reluctant to wear ankle braces until after sustaining an injury due to discomfort and performance hindrance, our objective is to create an ankle brace that delivers comparable protection to rigid counterparts during high-risk situations while offering complete flexibility during low-risk periods.

# What I learned
More coming soon.
